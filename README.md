# toggletally

Toggle Tally helps me remember if and when things happened and what state something is in at any given moment. 
A toggle is a switch that tracks various states: on, off and possibly more.
A tally is a running log that lets me count occurances and record a time and date associated with the occurance.

## Interface

Toggles and tallies should be easy to access on the app interface but I need to be able to organize them into groups if necessary.
