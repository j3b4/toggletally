# toggletally

Toggle Tally is an Android app helps me remember if and when things happened and what state something is in at any given moment. 
A toggle is a switch that tracks various states: on, off and possibly more.
A tally is a running log that lets me count occurances and record a time and date associated with the occurance.

## Interface

Toggles and tallies should be easy to access on the app interface but I need to be able to organize them into groups if necessary.

The app screen will present a button for each tally.
Touching a button will instantly record (tally) the instance of a thing including a time stamp.
Long touching a button will open a menu with access to functions such as:
  * entering an arbitrary time/date
  * adding a description and tags for the particular instance
  * archive or delete the tally
  * edit the name/look and feel of a tally
